      <h2 id="how-chosen" data-spy="how-chosen">How We Chose the Five Recipes</h2>
      <p>Every recipe below is built around a single hero ingredient that is at absolute peak ripeness right now. We start with what the farm is actually producing, and then design a dish around it — never the other way around. That is the whole secret of easy, flavourful, affordable cooking when you shop seasonal.</p>

      <h2 id="five-recipes" data-spy="five-recipes">The Five Recipes</h2>

      <h3>1. Ooty Spinach &amp; Nutmeg Pulao</h3>
      <p>Baby spinach from our Ooty farms is impossibly tender this month. Bloom whole spices in ghee, fold in the spinach until it just wilts, and finish with a whisper of fresh nutmeg. Twenty-five minutes from pot to plate.</p>

      <h3>2. Nagpur Orange &amp; Beet Salad</h3>
      <p>The first sugar-sweet Nagpur oranges have arrived. Segment them, toss with roasted beet cubes from Pune, and dress with orange juice, mustard, and a pinch of flaky salt. The colour alone is worth it.</p>

      <h3>3. Maharashtra Vine-Tomato Curry</h3>
      <p>Sun-ripened vine tomatoes form the entire sauce — no puree, no canned anything. Cook them down with mustard seeds, curry leaves, and a handful of fresh coriander. Serve with hot rice and ghee.</p>

      <h3>4. Bangalore Basil Pesto Pasta</h3>
      <p>Our Bangalore herb farm grows sweet basil that smells like it belongs in a perfume bottle. Grind it with roasted peanuts (a South Indian twist), garlic, and olive oil. Toss with any short pasta and cherry tomatoes.</p>

      <h3>5. Konkan Coconut &amp; Ridge Gourd Stir-Fry</h3>
      <p>Ridge gourd is at its monsoon peak — mild, hydrating, and quick-cooking. Stir-fry with grated coconut, slit green chillies, and a pop of mustard seeds. Five ingredients, ten minutes, zero leftovers.</p>

      <h2 id="pantry" data-spy="pantry">Stock the Pantry</h2>
      <p>You do not need a spice drawer of forty jars. A good basmati, cold-pressed oil, mustard seeds, curry leaves, garlic, and one good chilli powder cover 90% of local Indian cooking. Everything else — the vegetables themselves — is the point.</p>

    body: `
      <h2 id="certification" data-spy="certification">Step 1: Read the Certification Mark</h2>
      <p>In India, genuine organic produce carries the India Organic (Jaivik Bharat) mark — a green leaf logo with a unique 12-digit certification number. Farm-direct sellers should be able to show you that number and the certifying body (like Aditi Organic, OneCert, or Control Union). If the only "certification" is a fancy sticker with no number, it is marketing.</p>

      <h2 id="appearance" data-spy="appearance">Step 2: Question the Appearance</h2>
      <p>Organic vegetables are rarely uniform. Expect crooked carrots, slightly imperfect tomatoes, and leaves with the occasional nibble mark. A flaw is not a sign of poor quality — it is a sign that pesticides were not used to produce a flawless-looking product. Shiny, identical, "perfect" produce at commodity prices should make you suspicious.</p>

      <h2 id="smell" data-spy="smell">Step 3: Smell and Taste</h2>
      <p>This is the test shoppers skip most often. A real organic tomato hits you with aroma the moment you cut it. Organic leafy greens taste green — grassy, sweet, alive. If a vegetable smells of nothing, it likely grew on chemical residue, not living soil. Growers who invest in soil health cannot fake the flavour.</p>

      <div class="pull-quote">"The best certification is a farm that will happily let you walk through it."</div>

      <h2 id="provenance" data-spy="provenance">Step 4: Ask Where It Was Grown</h2>
      <p>A vendor who cannot tell you the farm, the district, and the harvest day does not know their supply chain. At FreshMarket every batch is traceable to a specific partner farm and a specific harvest date — and we publish lab test results for pesticide residues on request.</p>

    body: `
      <h2 id="science" data-spy="science">The Science of Immune-Boosting Foods</h2>
      <p>Immunity is not a switch you flip — it is a daily building process. White blood cells, antibodies, and antioxidant enzymes all depend on micronutrients: zinc, vitamin C, vitamin A, folate, and the polyphenols found in colourful plants. Eating a variety of vegetables across the week gives your immune system the raw materials it needs. No single food "boosts immunity"; a pattern of eating does.</p>

      <h2 id="veg-list" data-spy="veg-list">The Eight Vegetables to Rotate</h2>

      <h3>1. Spinach</h3>
      <p>Rich in folate, iron, and vitamin C — and the lutein and zeaxanthin that protect your skin and eyes. Lightly cook it to release oxalates and improve iron absorption.</p>

      <h3>2. Broccoli</h3>
      <p>A single cup of broccoli covers your daily vitamin C need. Sulforaphane, its signature compound, activates antioxidant enzymes that protect cells from damage. Steam lightly — never boil it into submission.</p>

      <h3>3. Garlic</h3>
      <p>Allicin, released when garlic is crushed and rests for ten minutes, has been shown in trials to reduce the severity of colds and flu. Add it late in cooking to preserve its active compounds.</p>

      <h3>4. Ginger</h3>
      <p>Fresh ginger dampens inflammation and nausea. Its gingerol compound is a natural antimicrobial — rescue a dull dal with a knob of it, grated raw.</p>

      <div class="pull-quote">"The immune system doesn't need a supplement — it needs a vegetable garden."</div>

      <h3>5. Cabbage</h3>
      <p>Fermented or raw, cabbage feeds the gut bacteria that train 70% of your immune cells. Red cabbage adds anthocyanin antioxidants that plain green lacks.</p>

      <h3>6. Carrots</h3>
      <p>Beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A) maintains the mucus membranes — the immune system's front-line barriers. One medium carrot covers your daily need; cook it in a little fat to double absorption.</p>

      <h3>7. Bell Peppers</h3>
      <p>Yellow and red bell peppers contain 2-3x more vitamin C than oranges. Eat them raw in salads to preserve every milligram.</p>

      <h3>8. Beetroot</h3>
      <p>Betanin, the pigment that stains your fingers, is one of the strongest natural antioxidants studied. Roast beetroots weekly and keep them in the fridge for easy addition to bowls and salads.</p>

      <h2 id="stir-fry" data-spy="stir-fry">Put Them Together: The Rainbow Stir-Fry</h2>
      <p>The easiest immunity habit is a weekly "rainbow wok" — grated carrot, sliced cabbage, broccoli florets, bell pepper, garlic, and ginger, flash-fried in cold-pressed oil. All eight vegetables, one pan, twenty minutes. Recipe below.</p>

By 6 AM, crates of leafy greens are already loaded into the chilled van that drives down the ghat to our Bengaluru hub.</p>

      <h2 id="sorting" data-spy="sorting">8:30 AM — Sorting and Grading</h2>
      <p>At the sorting shed, three generations of the Subramaniam family stand shoulder to shoulder. Damaged leaves are stripped for compost; misshapen produce is not wasted — it goes to a local temple kitchen programme. Only the best 80% of the harvest ever reaches your order box. "We grade honestly," says Ravi Subramaniam, "because our name is on every box."</p>

      <div class="pull-quote">"We grade honestly, because our name is on every box." — Ravi Subramaniam</div>

      <h2 id="soil" data-spy="soil">11 AM — The Soil Philosophy</h2>
      <p>Walk the terraces and you will find compost pits, neem trees planted as windbreaks, and basil rows between vegetable beds — a live pest-management system. The farm has not used synthetic fertiliser in 14 years. Instead, cow dung from their own herd, vermicompost, and green manure crops rebuild the soil that grows the food. Healthy soil is the entire business model.</p>

      <h2 id="numbers" data-spy="numbers">The Numbers Behind the Day</h2>
      <p>42 acres · 68 varieties · 40,000 crates a year · zero synthetic inputs since 2012 · 9 full-time families on the payroll. The economics work because the buyers (that is, you) pay enough for food that was grown properly — the exact trade-off FreshMarket was built around.</p>

      <p>Grown on the red laterite soils of the Konkan coast, Alphonso is the only Indian mango with a GI tag. Golden saffron flesh, intoxicating aroma, zero fibre — the standard by which all others are judged. Peak: April to June, and briefly again in smaller volumes now. Ripen at room temperature; refrigerate only once soft.</p>

      <h2 id="kesar" data-spy="kesar">Kesar — The Saffron Mango of Gujarat</h2>
      <p>Named after the saffron colour of its flesh, Kesar is sweeter and less acidic than Alphonso with a honeyed finish. From the foothills of Gir, it is the smoothest mango for milkshakes and lassi because it purees like silk. Peak: May to July.</p>

      <h2 id="dasheri" data-spy="dasheri">Dasheri — The North Indian Classic</h2>
      <p>Elegant, slender, and famously aromatic, Dasheri was first grown in the gardens of Lucknow in the 18th century. Low fibre and intensely sweet — the daily-drinking mango of Uttar Pradesh households. Peak: June to July.</p>

      <h2 id="langra" data-spy="langra">Langra — The One That Ignores Fashion</h2>
      <p>Green-skinned even at full ripeness, Langra is a mango that refuses to look the part but tastes magnificent — honeyed, slightly tart, with a firm flesh that holds its shape in salads. Peak: July to August, making it the late-season hero.</p>

      <p>Frozen banana, baby spinach, and a thumb of ginger blended with yoghurt. Top with kiwi coins and granola. The ginger wakes you up better than coffee.</p>

      <h2 id="one-pot" data-spy="one-pot">Why One-Pot Works</h2>
      <p>Classic biryani fans will object, but for a home kitchen the one-pot method wins every weeknight: all the steam stays in the pot, so the vegetables steam themselves to perfect tenderness inside the rice. Less washing up, less skill required, and the layered flavour still lands.</p>

      <h2 id="flavour" data-spy="flavour">Layers of Flavour</h2>
      <p>Three layers do the work. First, a spiced base of onions, ginger-garlic, and tomato cooked dark and jammy. Second, your vegetables — root veg first, leafy last. Third, the rice with whole spices, saffron milk, and herbs scattered on top before the lid goes on for good.</p>

      <div class="pull-quote">"In a one-pot biryani, the vegetables are not a filling — they are the architecture of the dish."</div>

      <h2 id="method" data-spy="method">The 3-Step Method</h2>
      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Rinse and soak basmati for 20 minutes while the spiced base cooks. <strong>Step 2:</strong> Lay in the vegetables, then the rice, then pour over boiled water with saffron and a sealed lid. <strong>Step 3:</strong> Twelve minutes on high, then eight minutes resting with the lid ON — the resting is where the magic happens. Never stir.</p>

      <h2 id="pairing" data-spy="pairing">Pairing Suggestions</h2>
      <p>Cool cucumber raita with roasted cumin, a wedge of lime, and sliced onions in lemon juice. If mango is in season, a small bowl of aamras on the side is the most luxurious contrast you can manage for under five rupees of fruit.</p>

      <p>Every ingredient in this juice earns its place: one leafy base for micronutrients, one root for anti-inflammatory power, one spice for antimicrobial action, one fruit for vitamin C, and water. Beyond that, you are just diluting the potency. Five is the maximum useful number.</p>

      <h2 id="the-five" data-spy="the-five">The Five Ingredients</h2>
      <p><strong>1. Baby spinach</strong> — folate, iron, vitamin C.<br><strong>2. Raw turmeric root</strong> — fresh curcumin is five times more bioavailable than the dried powder.<br><strong>3. Fresh ginger</strong> — gingerol for inflammation and nausea.<br><strong>4. Lemon</strong> — vitamin C plus the citric acid that helps curcumin absorb.<br><strong>5. A pinch of black pepper</strong> — piperine multiplies curcumin absorption by 2,000%.</p>

      <div class="pull-quote">"Piperine is the difference between drinking turmeric and absorbing it. Never skip the pepper."</div>

      <h2 id="when" data-spy="when">When to Drink It</h2>
      <p>On an empty stomach, before breakfast, every day during monsoon. The curcumin compounds are fat-soluble — if the juice makes your stomach feel sharp, add a teaspoon of coconut oil and blend. Expect the first noticeable difference in energy within a week.</p>

      <h2 id="ratio" data-spy="ratio">The Perfect Ratio</h2>
      <p>Two parts ripe mango to one part thick curd, a splash of milk to loosen the blend, and honey only if the mango needs it. A truly ripe Alphonso or Kesar is sweet enough on its own — the honey is insurance, not a requirement. Ice goes in the glass, never in the blender.</p>

      <h2 id="honey" data-spy="honey">Why Raw Honey Beats Sugar</h2>
      <p>White sugar adds sweetness and nothing else. Raw honey carries antioxidants, enzymes, and a floral dimension that changes the whole flavour profile. Use it sparingly — a tablespoon per two glasses is plenty. The cardamom is the secret handshake: two crushed pods make the difference between a good lassi and a memorable one.</p>

      <div class="pull-quote">"A great lassi is 90% the quality of its mango and 10% nerve. Buy the best fruit you can afford."</div>

      <h2 id="occasions" data-spy="occasions">A Lassi for Every Occasion</h2>
      <p>For breakfast, blend in a spoon of chia and serve thick. For the classic thali finish, keep it frothy and tall with a chilled steel glass. For a grown-up twist, an extra pinch of roasted cumin powder on top cuts the sweetness beautifully. One recipe, three moods, zero sugar.</p>
